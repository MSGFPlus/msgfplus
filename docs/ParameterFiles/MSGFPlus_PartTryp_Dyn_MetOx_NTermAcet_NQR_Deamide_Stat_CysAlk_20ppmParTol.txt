#Enzyme ID

#Isotope error range
#  Takes into account of the error introduced by choosing non-monoisotopic peak for fragmentation.
#  Useful for accurate precursor ion masses
#  Ignored if the parent mass tolerance is > 0.5Da or 500ppm
#  The combination of -t and -ti determins the precursor mass tolerance.
#  e.g. "-t 20ppm -ti -1,2" tests abs(exp-calc-n*1.00335Da)<20ppm for n=-1, 0, 1, 2.
